# z3-web

This project exposes a locally-installed Z3 instance as a web service.

## Installation

Run:

```
$ npm install
```

You will also need to ensure that [Z3 is installed locally](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases). It should be in the path of whatever shell you use to run `npm` below.

## Running

Run:

```
$ npm run start
```

The web service will listen on `http://localhost:3456` by default.
